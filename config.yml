          subtitle: "I am a senior studying **economics**, **information science**, and **mathematics** at the **[University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/)**, and I will be joining **[Analysis Group](https://www.analysisgroup.com/)**’s **Washington, D.C.** office as an Analyst after graduation.<br><br>\n\nAt my core, I am an **empirically minded researcher‑in‑training**. I am most energized by work that uses data to clarify real tradeoffs, surface patterns that are not immediately visible, and inform decisions that actually matter. I am less interested in theory for its own sake, and more drawn to careful empirical work that helps name experiences, quantify impacts, and move debates forward.<br><br>\n\nMy interests sit at the intersection of **labor and public economics**, **applied econometrics**, and **policy‑relevant industrial organization**, with particular motivation around questions of work, inequality, social programs, and market power.<br><br>\n\nAlongside economics, I enjoy the craft of data analysis itself: building clean workflows, creating thoughtful visualizations, and translating complex results into something readable and useful — especially for audiences without a technical background.<br><br>\n\nI am early in my career and actively shaping my research identity, with a focus on learning well, contributing meaningfully, and doing work that is careful, grounded, and ultimately informative."
