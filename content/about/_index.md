# About

Hi — I’m Alejandro De La Torre. I’m a senior studying **economics**, **information science**, and **mathematics** at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison**, and I’ll be joining **Analysis Group** in **Washington, D.C.** as an Analyst after graduation.

I’m an **empirically minded researcher‑in‑training** who enjoys using data to clarify real tradeoffs, surface patterns that aren’t immediately visible, and inform decisions that matter. I’m less drawn to theory for its own sake and more motivated by careful empirical work that helps name experiences, quantify impacts, and move debates forward.

My interests (at the moment) sit at the intersection of:

- **Labor and public economics**
- **Applied econometrics**
- **Policy‑relevant industrial organization**

I’m especially energized by questions around work, inequality, social programs, and market power — areas where institutional detail and identification really shape the story.

Alongside economics, I care about the craft of analysis itself: building clean workflows, creating thoughtful visualizations, and translating complex results into something readable and useful, especially for audiences without a technical background. I like when analysis is rigorous and accessible.

Outside of research and work, I stay curious — often through running, data visualization experiments, or the occasional bout of competitive Excel, among other things.

I’m early in my career and actively shaping my research identity. For now, my focus is simple: **learn well, contribute meaningfully, and do work that is careful, grounded, and genuinely informative**.
