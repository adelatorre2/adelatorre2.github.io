## All 2025  
Hi! I’m a senior at the University of Wisconsin–Madison studying economics, soon to be joining Analysis Group’s Washington, D.C. office as an Analyst after graduation.

I enjoy exploring how economic ideas and data can be applied to real-world questions, especially in areas that touch policy, markets, and law. My academic background leans heavily into math and data analysis, and I’m excited to keep building those skills in a professional setting.

More broadly, I’m interested in opportunities that connect economics to real decisions — whether in research, government, or litigation support. I’m still early in my journey, and I’m eager to learn, contribute, and grow alongside others who care about using careful analysis to solve meaningful problems.

Outside of academics and work, I try to keep myself balanced and curious.

Hi! I’m a senior at the University of Wisconsin–Madison studying economics, information science, and math, and I’ll be joining Analysis Group’s Washington, D.C. office as an Analyst after graduation.

At my core, I’m an empirically minded researcher-in-training. I’m most energized by work that uses data to clarify real tradeoffs, surface patterns that aren’t immediately visible, and inform decisions that actually matter. I’m less interested in theory for its own sake, and more drawn to careful empirical work that helps name experiences, quantify impacts, and move debates forward.

My interests currently sit at the intersection of labor and public economics, applied econometrics, and policy-relevant industrial organization — fields that value identification, institutional context, and real-world grounding. I’m especially motivated by policy-relevant questions around work, inequality, social programs, and market power.

Alongside economics, I enjoy the craft of data analysis itself: building clean workflows, making thoughtful visualizations, and translating complex results into something readable and useful — especially for audiences without a technical background. I like when analysis is not just rigorous, but also accessible.

I’m still early in my career and actively shaping my research identity. Right now, my focus is on learning well, contributing meaningfully, and doing work that’s careful, grounded, and ultimately informative.
