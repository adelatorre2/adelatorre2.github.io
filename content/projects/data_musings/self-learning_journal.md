# Self-Learning Journal

If there is anything that my UW-Madison years have taught me, is that you can learn almost anything and stars do not need to align for that to be possible. 

Often times I find myself going down some reddit-rabbit-hole and try some neat new data or coding trick--or maybe I am learning something new on [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) to review or learn new skills. In any case, I try to document and keep tabs on my learning and keep it all contained in my [self-learning journal](https://github.com/adelatorre2/adlt-learning-journal).

This repo is primarily for personal use and growth. You're welcome to explore, learn from, or fork it if you're on a similar path. No guarantees that everything is up-to-date or typo-free—it's a snapshot of a learning journey in motion.
